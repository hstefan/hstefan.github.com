So, this month's entry for [One Game a Month](http://www.onegameamonth.com/) is going to be a little different.
We gathered some local folks interested in game development and decided to make a 48 hour game jam in the fashion
of Ludum Dare jam.

The event is going to start at 2014-08-02 01:00 AM GMT. At the time of writing we have about 10 people who'll be
participating, most of them on-site and a few remotely. The rules are pretty simple, each participant will suggest
4 themes and we will pick 3 random ones in the first day of the jam. Whether the groups want to focus on only one
theme or mix them is up to them.

If you want to join us, get in touch! You can find me at [@hstefan](http://twitter.com/hstefan) or leave a coment
