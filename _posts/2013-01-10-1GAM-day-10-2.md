After some thinking, I think I have a more precise definition for this game. You can move around with your character, Z.E.R.O, and your objective is to complete each level in the shortest time, doing that by getting to an specific door on each level (only one). Another secondary objective is to take care of your jetpack's fuel, which is required in order to fly up with it,
and can be picked-up around the map.

So, spawn, keep an eye for how much fuel you have and try to find the exit. I'm not really sure how I'm going to handle the "out of fuel" event, maybe I'll just give infinite tries and keep adding "deaths" as penalty time, or maybe that'll end our quest.

When I first thought about maze-like levels, I planned to generate them procedurally, but I think I won't make it in time, since it would be a little tough job to build some algorithm. So, today I got to a simpler idea: let's do the maps statically, parse the map file and ta-da. Example below.

How does that all look to you? Your feedback is really welcome and needed, I'm easily found on [twitter](http://www.twitter.com/hstefan)!
