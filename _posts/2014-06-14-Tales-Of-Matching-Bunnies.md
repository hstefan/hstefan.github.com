Hello there.

After a few months of procrastinacion I finally managed to send something to [One Game a Month](http://www.onegameamonth.com/)!
This post cames a bit late, since the game has been submitted as may's entry, but unfortunately I seem to forget
very easily that I have a page.

It's a pretty simple card matching game, written in C++ and SDL2. Since I'm now using Arch Linux as my operational system,
it was a very interesting oportunity to learn how cross-compilation works in order to provide builds for Windows 
systems. This became a little nasty since I had some extra dependencies besides SDL2 itself, which also resulted
in a lot of DLLs to ship with the build.

You can play the game [here](/files/TalesOfMatchingBunnies.zip). Have fun!
