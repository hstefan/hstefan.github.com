I think I finally came to a definition for my level system. Originally, I thought about generating - oh well, I didn't even explain my game yet, let's do that first.

You control Z.E.R.O, a regular guy with a jetpack. You can do four basic movements, up, left, right and fall, and one simple action: pick up fuel. 

Your main objective is to complete each level in the shortest time, you do that by getting to an specific door on each level (only one). In short, you just have to find something inside our maze-like level.

Well, I never heard of a jetpack that works all by himself, did you? In order to keep using your jetpack, you've got to pick-up fuel, which can be found in several places of the map.

So, spawn, keep an eye for how much fuel you have and try to find the exit. I'm not really sure how I'm going to handle the "out of fuel" event, maybe I'll just give infinite tries and keep adding "deaths" as penalty time, or maybe that'll end our quest.

Now that we both understand a little better how I hope to make the game work, I can get back to the first paragraph. When I first thought about maze-like levels, I planned to generate them procedurally, but I think I won't make in time, since it would be a little tough job to build some algorithm for that. So, today I got to a simpler idea: let's do the maps statically, parse the map file and ta-da. Example below.

How does that all look to you? Your feedback is really welcome and needed, I'm easily found on [twitter](http://www.twitter.com/hstefan)!
