Our game jam was a big success! We had four teams participating and everyone managed to finished a game on time, even the guys 
who didn't have a programming-focused person. Absolutely amazing!

On friday we decided change the rules a little bit and pick 5 random themes, instead of 3 as we intended. Freely translating, the
themes were: Dragon, Chthulhu is the Good Guy, Mad Max Bicycles, Armless Peon and Return of Custer's Revenge.

In the next days I'll write a post for each of the games developed on the jam and a link for each of the games.
