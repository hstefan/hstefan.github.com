This game was developed in 48 hours during a game jam we organized in the city. We formed a team with Diogo Rodrigues and
[Orlando Fonseca Junior](https://twitter.com/smashrs) in charge of the art and [me](https://twitter.com/hstefan) and
[Yuri Schlesner](https://twitter.com/yuriks) programming. Our game is based on one of the themes drawn at the event,
"Mad Max Bicycles".

The initial idea was a local multiplayer joust game with bicycles, where the players would fight using spears and
shields picked up from the map. However, in the last 6-ish hours we decided this first idea wasn't feasible in due time
and simplified the mechanic a lot.

We changed our game to a competition whe player picks the most orbs until time runs out wins. It certainly isn't what 
we wanted before, but the game turned out to be pretty fun to play. Plus, I think the visuals of the whole thing are
awesome (I'm even using our background as a wallpaper right now).

You can download the game [here](/files/MadMaxBicycles.zip). The controls for player one are left, right and up arrows,
and for the second player A, D and W.
