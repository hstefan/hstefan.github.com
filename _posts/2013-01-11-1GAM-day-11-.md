I just spend a bit of time on Z.E.R.O and although it's not much, we finally have something to show.
![Z.E.R.O.](/images/zero_2013_01_11.png)

Today I coded this simple hud, which probably won't change that much (in terms of information displayed), and also
worked on character movimentation.

You can check out the build [here](/files/zero-build-2013-11-01.7z) and the code [here](https://github.com/hstefan/Z.E.R.O).

On a last note, I was looking for some nice font for this hud and came across [Open Font Library](http://openfontlibrary.org), 
so if you're looking for an open font and haven't met this site yet, you can give it a try.
