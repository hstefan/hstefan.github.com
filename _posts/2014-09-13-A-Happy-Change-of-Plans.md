It's been a while that I don't update this blog. That's because, originally, this website was inteded 
to keep track and show my monthly entries for [One Game a Month](http://www.onegameamonth.com/) and I
haven't sent any more games to the event for the last two months.

I got very excited about one of my ideas for the August entry and decided to put more time and effort
on it, as I really want to explore the potential I believe it has. That being said, juggling One Game
a Month, a full-time job and this new game won't be possible, so I decided to stick with the last two
and use this website as a development blog.

Being a game designer is something that I'm not used at all used to, so I'm still trying to grasp
some of the basic concepts involved in the role. I'm currently prototyping several gameplay elements,
so it doesn't make much sense to explain the current state of the game, as it's volatile and likely to
change in the near future. However, as things start to take a more definitive shape, I'll write a bit
about it here and try to get some feedback.

See you soon!
