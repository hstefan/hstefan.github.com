I've been a little busy these past days, so, unfortunately, I don't have any progress to show, besides a lot of under-the-hood stuff.

I think I'm really close to a level builder already, the parser is working and I'm storing each level tile on way that I think will help me to finish this game a lot quicker (unregarding my old enemy, art). 
Perhaps this last problem will not be that complicated, since some co-workers look avaible enough to give some help (I might get really nice sprites!).

Well, see you soon, I hope.
